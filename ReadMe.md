BlackJack

This is my first attempt at creating a blackjack application in
p5.js.

There is still quite a bit to do, with the application, as this is a very
rough sketch.

TODO:

1) The graphics are very basic and in no way the final idea I have in mind,
so they greatly need to be updated.

2) There is quite a bit of refactoring that needs to be done. There are a lot
of hard-coded values present, as well as many sections that probably need to be completely redone

3) There are many functions I'd still like to add such as a betting system, insurance, doubling down, and many more blackjack specific functions

4) Eventually, once the app has been refactored, I would like to introduce some sound and animation into the game to liven it up.
